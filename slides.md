### Most important: Switches

- Choose the most convenient for you (linear, tactile, clicky)
- Have the right pressing weight
- Is it pre-lubed?

===

### Wait you said lubed?

Yep

- Less spring noise
- Smoother presses

<!-- NOTE: You can do it yourself if you have unlubed switches (or you want to relube it), or buy pre-lubed ones that saves you lots of trouble. -->
<!-- TODO: Get some more usefull images -->

===

### And it's not just the switches

There are lots of factors, e.g.:

- Material of keycaps
- Material of case
- Material of plate
- Gasket
- Foaming
